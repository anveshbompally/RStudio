# RStudio
This repository contains of 2 R Markdown files in which I demonstrate different clustering methods to synthetic and real-world data and validate using external and internal validation techniques. And also the world indicators dataset compares different countries based on selected attributes.

Task 1

Data sets,  “Data1.csv”, “Data2.csv”, “Data3.csv”, “Data4.csv”, “Data5.csv”, “Data6.csv”,
“Data7.csv”, “Data8.csv” contain the data points and their respective class information.
For each of the datasets the below steps have been implemented
1. Used K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters
2. Evaluated the performance of the clustering algorithm using external validation
metrics
3. Plotted 3D data points for each dataset and color them according to the
original class
4. Plotted 3D the data points for each dataset and color them according to the
class allocated by the clustering algorithm

Task 2

The world indicators dataset compares different countries based on selected attributes.
1. Used  K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries
together
2. Used Internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality
3. Reported the best clustering solution. Gave a detailed list of all the groups and the
countries included within the groups
4. Generated three different scatter plots according to the groups and found out meaningful insights which I have explained in the R Markdown file
